    "# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets about Apple and Google Products  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction  \n",
    "In today’s digital world, social media platforms like Twitter play a crucial role in shaping public opinion about brands and products. Companies such as **Apple** and **Google** rely on customer feedback to improve their products, enhance user experience, and guide marketing strategies. However, the large volume of tweets makes it challenging to manually track and interpret public sentiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to build a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) model** that can automatically classify tweets as **positive, negative, or neutral**. By analyzing sentiment at scale, Apple and Google can gain valuable insights into how customers perceive their products, identify areas of improvement, and make data-driven business decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow the full data science process — from **data understanding and preprocessing**, through **model building and evaluation**, to **communicating results** for both technical and non-technical audiences.  \n"

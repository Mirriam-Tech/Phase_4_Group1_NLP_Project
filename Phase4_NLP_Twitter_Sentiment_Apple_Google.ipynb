    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze public sentiment on Apple and Google products using a dataset of approximately 9,000 tweets collected by CrowdFlower and hosted on data.world. Each tweet is human‑labeled as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, making it well‑suited for a supervised sentiment classification task. Our stakeholder is a technology market research team seeking actionable insights into how consumers perceive competing products in real time. Accurate sentiment classification allows the team to monitor brand perception, identify reputational risks, and adapt communication strategies quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation addressed the short, noisy nature of tweets. We removed links and @mentions, normalized casing, preserved meaningful hashtag words, and stripped punctuation and HTML artifacts. We experimented with keeping vs. removing stopwords to gauge impact on sentiment detection. Feature extraction included **TF‑IDF** n‑grams for baseline models. Key libraries: **scikit‑learn** (modeling & evaluation), **NLTK** (cleaning), and **Hugging Face Transformers** (advanced modeling).\n",
    "\n",
    "We followed an iterative strategy. First, a **binary proof‑of‑concept** (positive vs. negative) using Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes demonstrated feasibility. Next, we expanded to **multiclass** (positive, neutral, negative) and tuned a **TF‑IDF + LinearSVC** pipeline with cross‑validation optimized for macro‑F1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation used stratified train/validation/test splits. We reported accuracy, precision, recall, **macro‑F1**, and confusion matrices to reflect balanced performance across classes. We added model interpretability via top n‑grams and optional **LIME** explanations for selected tweets. We conclude with stakeholder recommendations for brand monitoring, negative‑spike alerts, and campaign impact analysis."
